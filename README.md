## 😮‍💨 Story Behind This Project

This project was born under pressure 😅 — assignment dropped the night before the deadline with a rule: must use **React + Flask**. I had projects but none matched the stack, so I started building a Resume Analyzer. 4 hours in, I realized it was too heavy for one night 😩.

Then came the idea 💡: a beautiful **To-Do App** with animations. Coded the whole thing in 2-3 hours, wrapped it up at 5 AM, slept at 5:30, woke up at 11:20, recorded the Loom video, and submitted right before 12 😎💥
